# T-rex-Runner-Muse-Headband-Control
This project contains the JavaScript library for the T-Rex game combined with a muse JavaScript SDK.
In order to use the Dinosaur game, I modified a Github repository (https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner) to simulate the key event of pressing space bar by blinking your left eye. The JavaScript SDK (https://github.com/urish/muse-js) that allowed me to read the EEG signal streamed by the headband is called Muse-JS. I also had to download install the JavaScript package dependency manager called Yarn(https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable). I then created a folder to unzip “Muse-JS”; I will refer to this folder as “muse-js”. To start the muse-js sample program (once you have yarn installed), in a command prompt on Windows or Terminal on the Mac in the directory you unzipped muse-js, execute: yarn then yarn start.
Now that the muse-js server is running on your computer and waiting for requests on the default port of 4445, in a Chrome tab type: http://localhost:4445/ . Turn on your Muse headband and click Connect! It should detect your device, something like Muse-9134. If you select and click “Pair”, it should start plotting the data the headband is streaming on graphs, one for each electrode. If your headband is correctly positioned, a quick test should show a steady signal on Electrode2 (channel ‘AF7’) when flinching your left eye.
